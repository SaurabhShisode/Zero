Zero

One problem a day. Zero regret.

Zero is a placement-focused consistency platform designed to help students and developers build strong technical habits through daily, intentional practice. Instead of overwhelming users with endless problem lists, Zero delivers exactly one curated challenge per day based on the user’s goals, skill preferences, and career targets.

The platform emphasizes discipline, deep thinking, and long-term growth over speed, rankings, and hype. By combining daily challenges, streak tracking, revision scheduling, and focused discussion, Zero turns interview preparation into a sustainable habit rather than a last-minute sprint.

What Zero Solves

Most practice platforms suffer from three core problems:

Too many problems, no structure

No accountability or habit building

Focus on speed instead of understanding

Zero fixes this by enforcing:

One problem per day

Explain before code

Built-in revision cycles

Consistency-first progress tracking

This ensures users practice with intent, not impulse.

Core Features
1. Daily Problem Engine

Users receive one curated problem every day based on their selected skills and difficulty level. Everyone practicing the same skill gets the same problem, enabling meaningful discussion and shared learning.

Supports:

Coding problems

MCQs

Debugging challenges

Output prediction questions

Each challenge is time-bound to simulate real assessment environments.

2. Skill Configuration System

Users personalize their preparation by selecting:

Skills: DSA, SQL, JavaScript, Java, System Design, CS Fundamentals and more

Difficulty level

Preferred language

Daily time commitment

Company focus like FAANG, Service-based companies, or Startups

This allows Zero to stay aligned with the user’s career goals instead of offering random practice.

3. Explain Before Code

Before marking a problem as solved, users must write a short explanation of their approach. This enforces structured thinking and prevents blind copy-pasting, helping build real problem-solving skills.

4. Consistency and Streak System

Zero tracks:

Daily streaks

Longest streak

Weekly consistency score

Missed days

Streak freezes

The focus is habit formation rather than competitive rankings.

5. GitHub-Style Heatmap

Each user has a visual heatmap showing daily practice activity. This provides a clear, motivating overview of consistency and growth over time.

Profiles can be shared publicly as a proof of discipline and commitment.

6. Revision Scheduler

If a user marks a problem as wrong or skips it, Zero automatically schedules revision attempts using spaced repetition:

After 3 days

After 7 days

After 14 days

This ensures weak areas are revisited instead of forgotten.

7. Placement Mode

A special interview simulation mode that:

Mixes skills in a single session

Adds time pressure

Includes behavioral and HR questions

Follows real online assessment patterns

This prepares users for actual hiring environments instead of isolated problem solving.

8. Company-Based Filtering

Each problem is tagged with:

Company names

Interview frequency trends

Difficulty patterns

Users can filter their preparation for specific companies such as TCS, Infosys, Amazon, or Google.

9. Focused Discussions

Every daily problem has its own discussion thread where users can:

Share insights

Discuss edge cases

Explain optimizations

Ask doubts

This avoids the noise of global forums and keeps discussions highly relevant.

10. Private Peer Comparison

Users can compare streaks and consistency with friends without public leaderboards. This encourages accountability without unhealthy competition.

11. Badge System

Meaningful achievements such as:

7 Day Consistency

30 Day Discipline

SQL Join Master

Zero Miss Week

Badges reward long-term habits, not short-term performance.
