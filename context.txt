Project Context: ZERO

Tagline: One problem a day. Zero regret.

High-Level Overview

Zero is a placement-focused consistency platform designed to help students and developers build real technical discipline through daily, structured practice. Instead of offering large problem libraries or gamified leaderboards, Zero enforces a minimal and intentional workflow: users receive exactly one curated problem per day per selected skill, must explain their approach before marking it solved, and automatically receive revision tasks for weak areas.

The platform is built around habit formation, deep understanding, and interview readiness rather than speed or competition.

Core Philosophy

Consistency over volume

Thinking before coding

Revision over repetition

Discipline over dopamine

Preparation over performance

Primary User Flow

User signs up and configures preferences

User selects skills, difficulty, time commitment, language, and company focus

Each day, the platform assigns one problem per enabled skill

User solves the problem on an external platform such as LeetCode or HackerRank

User returns to Zero and marks the problem as solved, wrong, or skipped

Before marking solved, the user must write a short explanation of their approach

If marked wrong or skipped, the platform schedules revision tasks automatically

Streaks, heatmaps, and badges update based on consistency

Users can discuss the problem in a dedicated thread

Users can compare streaks privately with friends

Feature Breakdown
Daily Problem Engine

Assigns one problem per day per skill

Same problem for all users who enabled that skill

Problems are stored as references with title, platform link, difficulty, company tags, and cooldown period

Supports coding, MCQs, debugging, and output-based questions

Time-bound challenge option for interview simulation

Skill Configuration System

Users can configure:

Skills such as DSA, SQL, JavaScript, Java, System Design, CS Fundamentals, Operating Systems, DBMS, Networking, Aptitude, Behavioral, and more

Difficulty level: Easy, Medium, Hard

Preferred programming language

Daily time commitment

Company focus: FAANG, Service-based, Startups, Any

Placement Mode toggle

Explain Before Code

User must write an approach note before marking a problem as solved

Minimum length validation to enforce thinking

Approach is stored with the solve record for review and analytics

Streak and Discipline System

Tracks:

Current streak

Longest streak

Freeze availability

Weekly consistency

Missed days
Streaks increase only when a problem is marked solved on consecutive days

Heatmap Profile

GitHub-style activity heatmap

Visualizes daily solves

Public shareable profile link

Shows recent activity and streak stats

Revision Scheduler

Automatically schedules revision tasks when a problem is marked wrong or skipped

Uses spaced repetition:

3 days later

7 days later

14 days later

Revisions are linked to original problems

Placement Mode

When enabled:

Mixes multiple skills into daily problems

Adds time pressure

Includes HR and behavioral questions

Simulates online assessment patterns

Adjusts difficulty dynamically

Discussions System

Each daily problem has its own discussion thread

Users can comment, reply, and share insights

Designed to avoid global noise and keep discussion focused

Shows recent activity on the daily problem card

Private Peer Comparison

Users can add friends using profile slugs

Can compare streaks and consistency metrics

No public leaderboard

Encourages accountability, not competition

Badge System

Examples:

7 Day Consistency

30 Day Discipline

Zero Miss Week

SQL Join Master
Badges are awarded automatically based on streak and skill-specific milestones

Technical Architecture
Frontend

React with TypeScript

Vite for development and builds

Tailwind CSS for design system and styling

Framer Motion for UI animations and transitions

Zustand for global auth and user state

Axios for API communication

Glassmorphism-inspired dark UI focused on minimalism and readability

Backend

Node.js with Express

TypeScript for strict typing

MongoDB with Mongoose

JWT-based authentication

Rate limiting middleware for auth routes

Modular structure:

Controllers for business logic

Routes for API mapping

Models for database schema

Services for reusable systems like badges

Middleware for auth and security

API Structure

Main route groups:

/api/auth

/api/daily

/api/preferences

/api/problems

/api/solve

/api/revision

/api/profile

/api/discussion

Protected routes use JWT middleware.

UI Design System

Dark-first minimal interface

Glassmorphism cards with soft glow and blur

Thin, modern typography using fonts like Geist, Space Grotesk, and Inter

High letter spacing and low visual noise

Focused cards instead of dashboards

Animations only to guide attention, not distract

Positioning

Zero is not a coding platform.
It is a discipline platform for placements and technical growth.

It differentiates itself by:

Enforcing one problem per day

Requiring explanation before completion

Automatically scheduling revisions

Prioritizing habit over leaderboard

Target Users

College students preparing for campus placements

Self-taught developers building interview readiness

Coding clubs and peer learning groups

Engineers maintaining long-term technical consistency

Long-Term Vision

AI-powered difficulty tuning

Smart weakness detection

Resume-ready consistency reports

Recruiter-accessible profiles

Native mobile app

Campus communities

Mock interview simulations

One-Line Summary for AI

Zero is a full-stack, habit-focused placement preparation platform that delivers one curated daily problem per skill, enforces explanation before solving, schedules spaced revisions automatically, tracks consistency with streaks and heatmaps, and provides focused discussions, private peer comparison, and interview simulation modes, all built with a modern TypeScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB architecture.
