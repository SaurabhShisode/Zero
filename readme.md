# ZERO  
**One problem a day. Zero regret.**

ZERO is a placement-focused consistency platform that helps students and developers build real technical depth through daily, intentional practice instead of binge-solving. It is designed around habit formation, structured thinking, and long-term retention rather than leaderboards and random problem grinding.

## Why ZERO Exists

Most coding platforms optimize for volume and speed. ZERO optimizes for clarity, memory, and consistency.

Instead of overwhelming users with thousands of problems, ZERO enforces a simple but powerful system:

- One carefully selected problem per day  
- Explain your approach before writing code  
- Revisit weak areas using spaced repetition  
- Track habits, not ranks  

This creates engineers who think better, not just type faster.

## Key Features

### Daily Problem Engine  
Receive one curated challenge every day across multiple formats:
- Coding problems  
- MCQs  
- Debugging tasks  
- Output prediction  

Problems adapt to your selected skills and difficulty level.

### Skill Configuration  
Customize your preparation across:
- Data Structures & Algorithms  
- SQL  
- JavaScript  
- System Design  
- Core CS subjects  
- Company-specific preparation  

### Explain Before Code  
Users must write a structured approach before marking a problem as solved. This reinforces reasoning, edge-case thinking, and interview-style communication.

### Streak and Consistency System  
Track your daily practice using:
- Current and longest streaks  
- GitHub-style activity heatmaps  
- Freeze days for emergencies  

### Smart Revision Scheduler  
Automatically revisits weak topics using spaced repetition:
- Day 3  
- Day 7  
- Day 14  

This ensures long-term retention instead of short-term memorization.

### Focused Discussions  
Each problem has a dedicated discussion space for:
- Edge cases  
- Optimization strategies  
- Alternative approaches  
- Peer-reviewed insights  

### Private Peer Comparison  
Compare streaks and consistency with friends without public leaderboards or ranking pressure.

### Badge System  
Earn meaningful milestones for:
- Long streaks  
- Skill mastery  
- Revision discipline  
- Consistent weekly practice
