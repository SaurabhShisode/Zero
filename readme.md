> One problem a day. Zero regret.

Zero is a placement-focused consistency platform designed to help students and developers build strong technical habits through daily, intentional practice.

## Why Zero?

Most practice platforms overwhelm users with endless problems, lack accountability, and prioritize speed over understanding. Zero solves this by enforcing:

- **One problem per day** – Curated challenges based on your goals
- **Explain before code** – Structured thinking over copy-pasting
- **Built-in revision cycles** – Spaced repetition for weak areas
- **Consistency tracking** – Habit formation over competitive rankings

## Core Features

**Daily Problem Engine** – One curated challenge daily (coding, MCQs, debugging, output prediction)

**Skill Configuration** – Personalize DSA, SQL, JavaScript, System Design, and more

**Explain Before Code** – Write approach explanations before marking solved

**Streak System** – Track consistency with daily streaks and GitHub-style heatmaps

**Revision Scheduler** – Automatic spaced repetition at 3, 7, and 14 days

**Placement Mode** – Interview simulation with time pressure and mixed skills

**Company Filtering** – Prepare for specific companies (Google, Amazon, TCS, etc.)

**Focused Discussions** – Problem-specific threads for insights and edge cases

**Peer Comparison** – Compare consistency with friends privately

**Badge System** – Meaningful achievements for long-term habits

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React + TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Zustand

**Backend:** Node.js + Express, MongoDB, JWT Authentication
